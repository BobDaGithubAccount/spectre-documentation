            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p1>
                Inspiration for the Plugin API came from Minecraft's Bukkit, Spigot and Paper plugin APIs, which are heavily event based, rather than Fabric, Forge and Sponge's
                approach of allowing injection or mixins for game-client and game-server change. Mojang as a developer, in my opinion, is flawed in its backing of MCP as it
                shouldn't be down to the community to develop mod loaders. Mojang should've developed their own API, keeping the low level, solo made networking and general
                spaghetti code hidden away to prevent the prevalence of ingame cheaters. While Optifine and many client side mods would've never been able to occur with
                a locked down, safe API, safe client API hooks, game optimisation and bundled textures + models, much like in gmod, would allow for 99.9% of current
                legit mods to be capable with proposed changes. However, this is my solo game engine project, so while I cannot influence Mojang, I can build my miniproject
                from the ground up to have a relatively safe API, to demonstrate my programming ability (hire me :D). <br><br><br>p.s joking

            <h1>Plugin crash course</h1>
            <p1>
                Plugins are JAR files that are loaded by the JVM class loader, scanning for annotations like @EventHandler for event methods, implementations of certain interfaces
                or abstract classes (Like JavaPlugin or Listener) + respective overrides (like the onEnable() entry point) and data files, loading it into memory. They can
                be used to add custom game logic, packet handling and with asset packages bundled to the client, custom items and entities. The beauty of plugins is that they
                are completely server side, allowing for complete control for the developer.
                <br><br>
                Plugins are located in the /plugins folder in the server's root directory. Exported plugins should be Java binaries stored as a JAR, and should be in the plugin
                folder. Their special data folder should be located at /plugins/"plugin_name", and the jar at /plugins/"plugin_name".jar
            </p1><br>
            <p1>
                Plugin jar datastructure should be as follows:<br>
                DataStructure:<br>
                ./plugin.txt<br>
                ./path.to.package.with.main.class/MainClass<br>
                The rest is up to you! It's just Java!
            </p1>
            <h2>Plugin.txt</h2>
            <p1>
                This file stores data about the plugin that is scanned upon load. The current, and required data points are all in the following :<br>
