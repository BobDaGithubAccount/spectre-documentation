            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p1>
                This Silver DofE project is game engine written in Java, which has a basic rendering pipeline written in LWJGL 2.X, using OpenGL. The goal is for it to support
                the source engine map format so the hammer editor can be the map editor, to have basic multiplayer functionality and to have server side modding capability.
                This project was made by <a href="https://github.com/BobDaGithubAccount/">ME</a>

                This is the game-client, that renders graphics and is the actual game instance.
                Its source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/BobDaGithubAccount/Spectre-Client">here</a>.

            <h1>Spectre-Server</h1>
            <p1>
                This is the game-server, that hosts gamelogic, forwards packets, enables multiplayer and server side modding.
                Hopefully its source code can be optimized in due course. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/BobDaGithubAccount/Spectre-Server">here</a>.
